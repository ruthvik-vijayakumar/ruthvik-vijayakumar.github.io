I led UI development for various products including POS, digital menu, and inventory management systems. My work spanned ideation to implementation, resulting in widespread adoption across India and Japan, with 361K+ users and $13M in revenue.

Additionally, I developed multi-platform printing tools that served over 1,200 restaurants, enhancing adoption and conversion rates.
