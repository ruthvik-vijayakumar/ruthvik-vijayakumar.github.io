As a key leader at Learnr.ai, I guided the evolution of a social education platform into an edu-influencer community. I developed product strategy, roadmaps, and PRDs, leading the product from concept to market launch. The platform secured funding and partnerships, attracting 80K+ users with 6.4K monthly actives. I managed cloud infrastructure, established development standards, and collaborated cross-functionally to ensure smooth product delivery and growth.
