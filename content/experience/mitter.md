For a messaging API platform, I developed a streamlined CMS using Webpack and Markdown, which reduced publish time by 43% and improved performance and SEO. I also boosted product adoption by creating a landing site, implementing performance monitoring with Google Analytics, enhancing the dashboard, and developing a showcase app.
